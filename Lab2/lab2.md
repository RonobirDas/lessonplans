For the entirety of the prelab refer (THAT DOESN'T MEAN READ THE ENTIRE THING) to the [Atmel Documentation Homepage](http://www.atmel.com/webdoc/index.html), [Atmega Datasheet](http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-42735-8-bit-AVR-Microcontroller-ATmega328-328P_Datasheet.pdf) and the [AVR ISA Manual](http://www.atmel.com/images/Atmel-0856-AVR-Instruction-Set-Manual.pdf) and chapter 2 of 	Programming and interfacing Atmel AVR microcontrollers by Thomas Grace which is freely available through UNLV's Lied Library [Direct Link which might not work](http://webpac.library.unlv.edu/search~S1/?searchtype=.&searcharg=b5268249). Additionally for a better details that were discussed in CpE 300 please refer to Digital Design and Computer Architecture, 1st Edition, available through the UNLV Library. Finally you may find it useful to refer to [The AVR Beginners Site](http://www.avrbeginners.net/). The sections below are what we are covering theoretically, so you can look them over and match to the above documents appropriately 

### Part 1, Software Developer Point of View: 
Read through the following pages: [AVR Memory Map](http://www.avr-tutorials.com/general/avr-memory-map), [AVR Program Counter](http://www.avr-tutorials.com/general/avr-program-counter), [AVR](http://www.avr-tutorials.com/general/avr-microcontroller-stack-operation-and-stack-pointer)
Additionally, in the AVRbeginners site check the section on the Stack
